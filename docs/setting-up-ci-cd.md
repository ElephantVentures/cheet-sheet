# Setting Up Continuous Deployment Via CircleCI

Continuous Deployment automates the updating of new code in our Api and UI so that we can focus on building features rather than worrying about how to launch them. CircleCI is easy to use, has a free tier, and takes away the hassle of have to set up infrastructure for it.

## STEP 1: Connect CircleCI to your repo

1. Login to CircleCI using your github account
1. Under add projects set up this repo

## STEP 2: Create the ENVIRONMENT variable out of your remote.env

1. In [Setting Up And Launching The App On AWS](/docs/setting-up-remote.md) find the `remote.env` file you made for code deploys
1. From the `.utils` folder run `node main.js create-infra-env` generate-base64-env. This will encode all contents of the `.env` file as base64 and spit it out.
1. The way we do continuous deployment is by mapping a branch in your repo to an environment variable that has the contents of `remote.env` (base 64 encoded). Out of the box, the following deployment strategies are provided. If you want to change the branch name, environment variable name, or add a new strategy, follow **STEP 3**.

    |   Branch      | CircleCI Environment Variable |
    |   ------      | ----------------------------- |
    |   master      | PROD_ENV_FILE                 |
    |   develop     | DEV_ENV_FILE                  |
    |   staging     | STAGING_ENV_FILE              |  
    |   demo        | DEMO_ENV_FILE                 |
1. Copy the output of the cli command, and set it as the desired Environment Variable.


## STEP 3: Update `.circleci/config.yml` if needed (Optional)

If you want to add more environments than supported out of the the box, modify the `load-env` command:

```yaml
load-env:
  steps:
    - run: # Extract environment variable as remote.env file
        name: "Load remote.env file from ENVIRONMENT variables"
        command: |
          if [ "${CIRCLE_BRANCH}" = "master" ]; then
              echo $PROD_ENV_FILE | base64 -d > remote.env

          elif [ "${CIRCLE_BRANCH}" = "develop" ]; then
              echo $DEV_ENV_FILE | base64 -d > remote.env

          elif [ "${CIRCLE_BRANCH}" = "staging" ]; then
              echo $STAGING_ENV_FILE | base64 -d > remote.env

          elif [ "${CIRCLE_BRANCH}" = "demo" ]; then
              echo $DEMO_ENV_FILE | base64 -d > remote.env

          else
              exit 1
          fi
```
