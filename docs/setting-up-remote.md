# Setting Up And Launching Cheet Sheet on AWS
All commands unless otherwise noted should be ran from the root of the project folder.

## Create Your infrastructure.env File

**Warning: if you've already made infrastructure.env before, it will be overridden. So save it if you don't want to lose it.**

1. From the .utils folder run `node main.js create-infra-env`
2. Follow the guided prompt to create `infrastructure.env`
3. Confirm you now have a file in your root folder called `infrastructure.env`

## Build AWS Infrastructure

**Note: ENVIRONMENT is what is defined in infrastructure.env**

1. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.deploy.infrastructure.yml up --build -d`
1. Run `docker container exec -it serverless-aws-cdk sh`
1. Run `npm run build`
1. Run `cdk bootstrap` (If you've done this before you don't have to do it again)
1. Run `cdk diff CheetSheetInfrastructureStack-{ENVIRONMENT}` to preview what will be deployed
1. Run `cdk deploy CheetSheetInfrastructureStack-{ENVIRONMENT}` to begin deployment and say yes to any prompts
1. Once it ran confirm in AWS Cloudformation you have a new stack called `CheetSheetInfrastructureStack-{ENVIRONMENT}` with the status `CREATE_COMPLETE`
1. Type in exit to leave the infrastructure deploy environment
1. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.deploy.infrastructure.yml down -v` to take down the infrastructure deploy environment

## Create Your remote.env File

**Warning: if you've already made remote.env before, it will be overridden. So save it if you don't want to lose it.**

1. From the .utils folder run `node main.js create-infra-env`
1. Follow the guided prompt to create `remote.env` from `infrastructure.env`
1. Confirm you now have a file in your root folder called `remote.env`

## Build and Deploy The Code

**Note: SITE_DOMAIN and SITE_SUB_DOMAIN are what is defined in infrastructure.env**

1. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.deploy.code.yml run --rm serverless-lambda-api sh deploy.sh`
1. The command above deploys your code for the API
1. Once it ran confirm in AWS Cloudformation you have a new stack called `CheetSheetCodeStack-{ENVIRONMENT}` with the status `CREATE_COMPLETE`
1. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.deploy.code.yml run --rm serverless-angular-client-ui sh -c "node build-env.js && npm run build-prod"`
1. You should now see a folder called `client-ui/angular-output`. In here is every thing you need for your front end to work.
1. In S3 find the bucket named `{SITE_SUB_DOMAIN}.{SITE_DOMAIN}`. Upload all those files here with Public Read access. Everything else can be left as default.

## Build and Connect the Networking

**Note: ENVIRONMENT is what is defined in infrastructure.env**

1. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.deploy.infrastructure.yml up --build -d`
1. Run `docker container exec -it serverless-aws-cdk sh`
1. Run `npm run build`
1. Run `cdk diff CheetSheetNetworkStack-{ENVIRONMENT}` to preview what will be deployed
1. Run `cdk deploy CheetSheetNetworkStack-{ENVIRONMENT}` to begin deployment and say yes to any prompts
1. Cloud Front takes a long time to provision, it can take anywhere from 30min-1hour to complete. So go grab a coffee while that's happening.
1. Once it ran confirm in AWS Cloudformation you have a new stack called `CheetSheetNetworkStack-{ENVIRONMENT}` with the status `CREATE_COMPLETE`
1. Your app should be up and running on the following URLs :beers::
    - https://cheet-sheet.mydomain.com
    - https://cheet-sheet.api.mydomain.com
1. Type in exit to leave the infrastructure deploy environment
1. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.deploy.infrastructure.yml down -v` to take down the infrastructure deploy environment

## What's Next
It will be a pain in the butt if you have to manually **Build and Deploy The Code** every time you want to make a change to the api or ui. I suggest you set up Continous Deployment of the code via CircleCI.
